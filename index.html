<h1>Selina Oberpriller</h1>

<p>I grew up in a town called Regensburg in the South of Germany close to Munich. Studied my undergrad in journalism not far from there and did a semester abroad in Lisbon, Portugal. A place I fell absolutely in love with.</p>
    
<p>But not only the place was great, I also realized being around people from very diverse backgrounds makes me learn the most about life (and about myself). Thus, I’m now studying in Denmark as one of 52 students of 33 nationalities in a Master’s program, called Erasmus Mundus Journalism – a combination of journalistic practice with political and communication science.</p>
  
<p>Before I'll move to Amsterdam for my second year this fall, I'm lucky enough to do my second semester as a visiting scholar at the J-School. In regard of the pandemic I'm more than glad to attend the classes virtually. However, going to California would have been a dream.</p>
